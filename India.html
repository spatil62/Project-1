    <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.</p>

    <p>One of Indiasâ€™ famous things is its mouth-watering spicy food. The country offers rich and deliciously flavored dishes unique in every taste being the largest producer and consumer of spices in the world.
If you are a foodie and happen to travel to India, you will love their full-flavored delicious food.
From the famous <strong>chicken tikka masala</strong> which is actually my favorite Indian dish, <strong>Murgh Makhani</strong> (butter chicken), <strong>Tandoori chicken</strong>, <strong>Naan</strong> to so many other palatable dishes, the Indian cuisine is unmatched and it will leave you licking your fingers if you love spiced food! Actually, even their tea is spiced up!
The fun part is that every region/state has its own unique signature recipe so prepare your taste buds to sample the variety of unique dishes.</p>
